Trump Lie: President Obama has doubled our national debt to more than $19 trillion, and growing.

Fact : “The total federal debt is at $19 trillion. But most of it was amassed before Obama took office.” [PolitiFact, 7/19/16]
%

Trump Lie: In 2009, pre-Hillary, ISIS was not even on the map. Libya was cooperating. Egypt was peaceful. Iraq was seeing a reduction in violence. Iran was being choked by sanctions. Syria was under control.

Fact : “The roots of ISIS trace back to 2004, when Bush was president and before Clinton was Obama’s secretary of state.” [PolitiFact, 7/20/16]
%

Trump Lie: My opponent has called for a radical 550% increase in Syrian refugees on top of existing massive refugee flows coming into our country under President Obama. She proposes this despite the fact that there’s no way to screen these refugees in order to find out who they are or where they come from.

Fact : PolitiFact rated Donald Trump’s claim that there was “no system to vet” refugees “False.” [PolitiFact, 6/13/16]
%

Trump Lie: Of all my travels in this country, nothing has affected me more deeply than the time I have spent with the mothers and fathers who have lost their children to violence spilling across our border.

Fact: Washington Post Fact Checker: “Data on immigrants and crime are incomplete, but a range of studies show there is no evidence immigrants commit more crimes than native-born Americans.” [Washington Post, 7/8/15]
%

Trump Lie: While Hillary Clinton plans a massive tax increase, I have proposed the largest tax reduction of any candidate who has declared for the presidential race this year – Democrat or Republican. Middle-income Americans will experience profound relief, and taxes will be simplified for everyone.

Fact: Moody’s Analytics report: Donald Trump’s tax plan would mostly benefit those at the very top of the income distribution, and job losses resulting from his economic policies would most affect lower- and middle-income households. [Moody’s Analytics report, 6/20/16]

Trump Lie: When the FBI Director says that the Secretary of State was “extremely careless” and “negligent,” in handling our classified secrets, I also know that these terms are minor compared to what she actually did.

They were just used to save her from facing justice for her terrible crimes.

In fact, her single greatest accomplishment may be committing such an egregious crime and getting away with it – especially when others have paid so dearly.

Fact: FBI Director Comey: “There’s all kinds of folks watching this at home or being told, ‘well, lots of other cases are being prosecuted and she wasn’t.’ I want them to know that’s not true!” [FBI Director James Comey Testimony, 7/7/16]
